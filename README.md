## TODO
- [ ] Make the "MIT-A(w)-curves" from scratch (instead of extracting from the famous Physics Today of Kotliar and Vollhardt); either by getting fresh IPT results (fast but maybe not ideal) or with a simple, neat analytical sketch of the shapes (better).
- [ ] Maybe have a simple script setting everything up, instead of working by hand on inkscape; so to make easier little changes and updates.
- [x] Rearrange and rotate the curves to get an "ED" instead of a "Î¨", ~~which may fit better the overall spirit of the codebase~~ [look at [`ED` branch](https://github.com/QcmPlab/LOGO/tree/ED)]
