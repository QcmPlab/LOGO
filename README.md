# [QcmP Lab](https://github.com/QcmPlab) - LOGO 

_This branch implements an idea proposed and promoted by [Francesca Paoletti](https://github.com/frapao), namely to move away from the overall "Ψ-shape" embracing instead an "ED", acronym for __Exact Diagonalization__, intended as a more representative keyword for the whole project. Given the current state of the codebases and the roadmap for future additions the idea has been __dropped__, as the scope appears to be too tight_.
 
 _Nevertheless we leave it here as it looks quite good and could still be useful in some form for the future._

## TODO
- [ ] Make the "MIT-A(w)-curves" from scratch (instead of extracting from the famous Physics Today of Kotliar and Vollhardt); either by getting fresh IPT results (fast but maybe not ideal) or with a simple, neat analytical sketch of the shapes (better).
- [ ] Maybe have a simple script setting everything up, instead of working by hand on inkscape; so to make easier little changes and updates.
- [x] Maybe we can rearrange and rotate the curves to get an "ED" instead of a "Ψ", which may fit better the overall spirit of the codebase [suggested by [@frapao](https://github.com/frapao)]
